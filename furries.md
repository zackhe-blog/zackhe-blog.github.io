# What are furries (and my opinion on them)
9 October 2025

Furries.


If you are normal, or even slightly<br>
retarded like me, chances are you have no<br>
idea what I'm talking about.

Taking that into consideration I'll tell you.


Furries are people who enjoy dressing up as animals.

Now, so far so normal(-ish), right?

But no, these aren't kids.

These are adults. Adults who dress up in their "fursuit" and, <br>
like a coward, try to escape reality.

Let's take a break from all my opinion rubbish.

Here's a fun fact: did you know 56% of furries are single?

And that approximately 45% live with their parents?

Oh... and they also have weird fetishes.

Take a look at this chart.

Do you see this? Do you see these charts?

Do you see the trend there?

Had enough of the facts now? Alright, I'll stop, be blunt, and give you my honest opinion.


These people are mentally ill and should seek help.
