# Holidays
Oct 8, 2025

Holidays, vacations. What is the point of them?

You just want to "take a break" and then struggle and exhaust yourself whilest doing so.

If that's not enough, it's time to pour thousands of dollars of your<br>
hard-earned money down the drain to spend on housing fuel, and gasoline.


I have to say though, at the end of it all you _do_ end up more relaxed.

Are you broke? Just a small side-effect.

You land home, and guess what? There's _more_ to do, go work now, go work.

Are you less stressed? Hardly. Are you more stressed? Extremely.

And of course, being the lazy person that the "AI" boom created - a computer program that is about as trustworthy as your dementia-sucumbing grandfather - you go get your best friend ChatGPT to do the boring bits.


Your client notices your emails are written with ChatGPT and fires you on the spot!

Ahh... what a relaxing holiday! A well deserved break! A nice rest.

But really, it is none of those things.

All it is in reality is a pain in the ass
