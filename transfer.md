# Transfer announcement
Oct 24, 2025

Hello ladies and gentlemen,<br>
<br>
as my newfound **genius** has figured that<br>
you don't have to create a whole new organisation<br>
to host a custom domaim GitHub Pages site, this<br>
blog will be transferred from the [zackhe-blog](https://github.com/zackhe-blog) organistation<br>
to the [main account](https://github.com/zackhe-uk) **as of... well, right now**.

The old holder organisation will be deprecated, but the URL will stay the same.
